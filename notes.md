Using Create react app

counting space between selectors:

<!-- (1032 - 249*4)/3 = 12 (but space for each element should be devide by two so 6 for each element)-->

counting paddings inside product[px]:
(603 - 553)/2 = 25
height:

between image and first header:
501 - (200 + 289 ) = 12

padding below header:
73 - 44 = 29

between sections:
152 - (73 + 71) = 8

two padding above can be connected
8+29 = 37

gap for all products:

<!-- (1046 - 338*3) / 2 = 16-->

price in 53,31 zÅ‚ x 60 rat is not correctly rounded to full price ? let's assume it is ok

padding inside buttons:
width: (150 - 70)/2 = 40
height: (36 - 16)/2 = 8

create component for input (we have 4 similar elements)

**Test that on console.log(maybe first try to do it without graphql)
