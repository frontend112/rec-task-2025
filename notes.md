Crea
te componnet with cart where we define single card
Componnent with cards where we get data from data base and showonly visible part(max should be visible 3)
Level up forms, filters etc

Set default visible vashing mashines to 3
If user clicks button below then add other 3 (setstate)

Use hooks to minimaze app reloading when we get data

Try to implement all code without show more button

Send env variables on notepad

Changing filters remove possible stare from button below

optionals:
**try to make this cool effect as on samsung.com - Washing machines shows slowly when scroll down
**Can we use here graphql to get only 6if user kliks plus maybe get another 6 elements and for other filter as well
**https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/graphql-apis-hasura/
**Test that on console.log(maybe first try to do it without graphql)
after installing react app -> found 6 high vulnerabilities

frontend problems:
dimensions:
inside product elements have 290px width

counting paddings inside product[px]:
(603 - 553)/2 = 25p
height:

between image and first header:
501 - (200 + 289 ) = 12

padding below header:
73 - 44 = 29

between sections:
152 - (73 + 71) = 8

two padding above can be connected
8+29 = 37

gap for all products:

<!-- (1046 - 338*3) / 2 = 16-->

(problem with calculating other exact paddings, maybe with figma pro would be easier)

price in 53,31 z≈Ç x 60 rat is not correctly rounded to full price ? let's assume it is ok

padding inside buttons:
width: (150 - 70)/2 = 40
height: (36 - 16)/2 = 8

create component for input (we have 4 similar elements)
